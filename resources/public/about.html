    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        Currently the best way to discover go streamers is stalking go game channel and word of mouth.
        In both cases it's easy to miss a lot of great content from less known streamers.
        This website aims to provide comprehensive summary of all go activity on Twitch.tv.
        If you wish to do so, you can follow all people on streamers list to get notifications when they go live or
        you can just check latest videos to see if there's anything that's of interest to you.
    </p>

    <h2>Implementation details</h2>
    <p>
        Information is collected by periodically checking "Go (Board Game)" game directory on Twitch.tv. Any live streamers
        are stored for future reference. Latest videos section contains last 20 videos from known streamers, excluding any non-go content.
        New streamer discovery is an ongoing process, so some people who haven't gone live since the launch of this site won't appear on the list.
